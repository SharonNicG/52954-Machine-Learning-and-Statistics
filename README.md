# Machine Learning and Statistics - 52954
***

## Project Description
For this project, we must create a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SharonNicG/52954-Machine-Learning-and-Statistics) containing 
- A clear and informative README.md explaining why the repository exists, what is in it, and how to run the Jupyter Notebooks it contains.
- A requirements.txt file enabling the quick running of the Jupyter Notebooks with minimal configuration and any other required files.
- Two Jupyter Notebooks
  - scikit-learn.ipynb, containing
    1. A clear and concise overview of the scikit-learn Python library.
    2. Demonstrations of three interesting scikit-learn algorithms. 
    3. Appropriate plots and other visualisations.

  - scipy-stats.ipynb, containing
    1. A clear and concise overview of the scipy.stats Python library.
    2. An example hypothesis test using ANOVA. 
    3. Appropriate plots and other visualisations.

## Prerequisites for the Project
To complete the assignment, I installed the full Anaconda package from https://www.anaconda.com.

The packages used in this repository (detailed below) are all part of the Anaconda package:

- Jupyter Notebook - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter or https://jupyter.org/
- NumPy package - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/numpy or https://numpy.org/
- Seaborn - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/seaborn or https://seaborn.pydata.org/
- Matplotlib - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/matplotlib or https://matplotlib.org/
- Pandas - Available via https://anaconda.org/anaconda/pandas or https://pandas.pydata.org/

## Running a Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter is a Python package and does not require importation from Python packages. It commonly runs from the machine command line.

To launch a Jupyter notebook, open your terminal/command line and navigate to the directory where you have saved the pulled Jupyter Notebook. Typing the command Jupyter Notebook into the terminal/command line creates an instance of Jupyter on a local server.

When Jupyter Notebook has been called from the terminal/command line, a browser window should open, showing the Jupyter Notebook interface. If it does not, you can copy the URL presented in the terminal/command line and paste this into your browser's address bar.

Once you have accessed the Jupyter Notebook interface, you can view the files in the current directory. Clicking on the files will open them. Jupyter notebook files are identifiable by their notebook icon (within the Jupyter Notebook interface and by the file extension .ipynb

Terminate the browser tab by clicking the "X" in the top right corner to close the notebook. To stop the instance on the local server and shut down the Jupyter kernel, press control-C in the terminal/command line.

The above steps should allow the Jupyter Notebook to display automatically (assuming the prerequisites were met). Jupyter Notebooks can also be rendered by pasting the URL presented in the terminal/command line on the site https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/.
